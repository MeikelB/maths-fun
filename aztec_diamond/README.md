# Aztec Diamond

The motivation for this project was given by the great math-youtube [Mathologer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg)

The Aztec diamond of order n, denoted by Az(n), is defined as the union of all the unit
squares with integral corners (x, y) satisfying |x| + |y| â‰¤ n + 1. A domino is simply a
1-by-2 or 2-by-1 rectangles with integral corners




# Algorithm
The aztec-diamond.py srcipt tiles dominos in a random order into a aztec diamond. By doing so you can see the effects of the aztec diamond theory.
The algorithm follows the steps described in this [video](https://youtu.be/Yy7Q8IWNfHM?t=1209).

Example run from source:
'''python aztec_diamond\aztec-diamond.py'''
